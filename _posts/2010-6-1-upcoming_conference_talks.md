June is a busy month when it comes to me speaking at conferences, you should drop by at least one of my talks, if you're
in the area.

This week is [RailsWayCon](http://www.railswaycon.de) in Berlin, and I'll be talking about Redis. Don't tell anyone, but
[my slides](http://redis-railswaycon2010.heroku.com/) are already up, in case you can't make it.

Next up is [Berlin Buzzwords](http://www.berlinbuzzwords.de), on June 7th and 8th in Berlin, where I'll be giving a
general introduction on NoSQL databases, their history and the current state of affairs. The conference is all about
scale, search and data, a definite must.

On June 18th I'll be speaking at [MongoUK](http://www.10gen.com/conferences/event_mongouk_18june10), about MongoDB and
document databases in general. If you want to come, use the coupon code paper\_planes for 20% off the full ticket price.

Then, last but no least, Ill be talking about MongoDB in general at [Cloud Expo Europe](http://www.cloudexpo-europe.com/) in Prague. 

Hope to see you at one of these conferences. Happy to chat about anything from databases to clouds, and to give you a
tour of [Scalarium](http://scalarium.com).

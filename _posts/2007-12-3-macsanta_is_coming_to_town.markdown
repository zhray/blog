Just like last year, [MacSanta](http://www.macsantadeals.com/) opened its doors right on time for the holiday season. They have some pretty good deals on some excellent Mac shareware. I stacked up already during last year's sale, but their daily deals are well worth keeping an eye on.

Also jumping on the Christmas deals bandwagon are [Give Good Food To Your Mac](http://www.givegoodfood2yourmac.com/kitchen34/index.php) and another [MacUpdate](http://www.mupromo.com/) sale. Though I gotta say I prefer the variety over at MacSanta. So go out and support those indie Mac developers.

Next week I'll attend and speak at the [RailsWayCon](http://it-republik.de/conferences/railswaycon/) conference in Berlin. You can see [me](http://it-republik.de/konferenzen/railswaycon/workshops/railswaycon/speaker/#3888) speak at the tutorial ["Deploying Rails Applications"](http://it-republik.de/konferenzen/railswaycon/workshops/), together with Jonathan Weiss, and talk about asynchronous processing in Rails applications. The [line-up](http://it-republik.de/konferenzen/railswaycon/sessions/) looks pretty good. See you there!

My friend [Deborah](http://ddot.wordpress.com) from Sydney started a blog called ["everyday polaroid"](http://everydaypolaroid.wordpress.com/) some weeks ago. She asked me to contribute my every day 'roids for this week. Come on over, have a look, and say hi!

Also, ['Roid Week 2008](http://www.flickr.com/groups/polaroidweek2008/) starts today over on Flickr. Coincidence? I think not. Even though Polaroid stops making film there's no reason not to celebrate instant photography as long as it lasts.

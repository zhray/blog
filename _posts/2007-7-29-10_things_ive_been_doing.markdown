1. Integrating [Ferret](http://ferret.davebalmain.com/trac), a very nice search engine for Ruby, in a project with [acts\_as\_ferret](http://projects.jkraemer.net/acts_as_ferret/wiki).
2. [Learning ten finger typing](http://www.paperplanes.de/archives/2007/7/23/learning_ten_finger_typing/).
3. Writing an article about one of my favorite clothing labels, New Zealand based [Huffer](http://www.huffer.co.nz/), for [the magazine](http://www.rauschmagazin.de/) of two friends.
4. Been hiking though [snowy mountains](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ipom/927272066/) in Norway on my summer holiday.
5. Reading ["RESTful Web Services"](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/) by [Leonard Richardson](http://www.crummy.com/) and [Sam Ruby](http://intertwingly.net/blog/). A highly recommended book on [REST](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) which I'm starting to like.
6. Doing my first real-life project with the features of Java 5. That might sound a little ridiculous, but the clients using Java I worked for over the last year all used Java 1.4, mainly for political reasons or restrictions of the application server environment (WebLogic 8.2 is a no-go with Java 5).
7. Finding more and more joy in photography, and at the same time starting to really like [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/).
8. Playing with [AP4R](http://ap4r.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?HomePage), an asynchronous job processor for Ruby and Rails. It looks like a very nice and more reliable way to do background tasks than [BackgrounDRb](http://backgroundrb.rubyforge.org/). The latter now has a new maintainer by the way. Maybe that will bring the mostly stalled development back up to par.
9. Working in my office. Something I really enjoy. Having a decent and quiet place to work in is important for a freelancer.
10. Looking for a new mobile. In case you're wondering the iPhone doesn't appeal to me.

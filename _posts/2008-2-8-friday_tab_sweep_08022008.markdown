Another week, another sweep.

 * [Garbage Collection is Why Ruby on Rails is Slow: Patches to Improve Performance 5x; Memory Profiling](http://blog.pluron.com/2008/01/ruby-on-rails-i.html)

 * [Guerilla's Guide to Optimizing Rails Applications](http://blog.pluron.com/2008/01/guerrillas-way.html)

 * [SwitchPipe](http://switchpipe.org/). Supposably an easy way to deploy web applications written in Rails, Camping, Ramaze, Merb and what have you.

 * [Anvil - Ruby MVC GUI Library](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/anvil-interview)

 * [Tapping Method Chains with Ruby 1.9](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/tap-method-ruby19). A nice gem in Ruby 1.9.

 * [Static typing considered harmful](http://blog.jayfields.com/2008/02/static-typing-considered-harmful.html). While the post itself is spot on, it was more the quote from Stuart Halloway that caught my eye: "In 5 years, we'll view compilation as the weakest form of unit testing." I have nothing to add.

 * [The Ultimate List of RubyCocoa Tutorials, Tips and Tools](http://www.rubyinside.com/the-ultimate-list-of-rubycocoa-tutorials-tips-and-tools-728.html).

 * [Ruby Cheat Sheets](http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-cheat-sheet-734.html)

 * [21 Merb Links, Tutorials and Other Resources](http://www.rubyinside.com/merb-tutorials-and-resources-716.html). Kudos to Peter Cooper for putting these lists together.

 * [Heroku](http://heroku.com/). An in-browser Rails environment. Code, collaborate, click deploy, and see your app running on EC2, all from your browser. Looking forward to giving it a go.

 * [FancyZoom](http://www.cabel.name/2008/02/fancyzoom-10.html). My word, that is smooth JavaScript image zooming, Panic style.

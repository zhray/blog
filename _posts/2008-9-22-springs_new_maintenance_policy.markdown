title: "Spring's New Maintenance Policy"

If Rails was anything like [Spring](http://www.springsource.com/node/558), we wouldn't see a 2.1.2 release anymore:

> "After a new major version of Spring is released, community maintenance updates will be issued for three months to address initial stability issues. Subsequent maintenance releases will be available to SpringSource Enterprise customers. Bug fixes will be folded into the open source development trunk and will be made available in the next major community release of the software . . . "

Right on. I can understand that SpringSource has to make money somehow, but way to screw over the community like that. But given the enormous amounts of money put into it by investors it's no surprise really.

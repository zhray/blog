title: Conference Talks You Should Be Watching
topics: video rubyish
---
Thanks to the guys from Confreaks, there's a whole bunch of video material from
conferences for the rest of us to enjoy. I've been watching quite a few recently, so
here's some recommendations of talks I found interesting.

* [BERT and Ernie: Scaling your Ruby site with Erlang](http://rubyconf2009.confreaks.com/19-nov-2009-10-25-bert-and-ernie-scaling-your-ruby-site-with-erlang-tom-preston-werner.html)

  Talk on the BERT protocol created by Tom Preston-Werner of GitHub.

* [Bits, Bytes, and BLOBs](http://rubyconf2009.confreaks.com/19-nov-2009-11-15-bits-bytes-and-blobs-brian-mitchell.html)

  Everything on bit shifting, binary protocols and whathaveyou. I'm a big fan of text-based
  protocols, but it's nice to get some perspective on the world of binary things as well.

* [NoSQL - Death to Relational Databases](http://rubyconf2009.confreaks.com/20-nov-2009-09-30-nosql-death-to-relational-databases-ben-scofield.html)

  The title is to be taken with a grain of salt obviously, but nonetheless, nice introduction to the
  most important players of the NoSQL world.

* [SOLID Ruby](http://rubyconf2009.confreaks.com/20-nov-2009-15-05-solid-ruby-jim-weirich.html)

  Jim Weirich on applying the SOLID principles to Ruby coding, though it's more of an introduction
  to the principles in general with a hint of Ruby.

* [Clojure for Ruby Programmers](http://rubyconf2009.confreaks.com/21-nov-2009-10-25-clojure-for-ruby-programmers-stuart-halloway.html)

  The title says it all.

* [Rippin' off Python](http://rubyconf2009.confreaks.com/20-nov-2009-16-20-rippin-off-python-chris-wanstrath.html)

  Nice talk on how Python solves some problems compared to Ruby.

* [Cooking with Chef - Your Servers will thank you](http://mwrc2010.confreaks.com/2010-03-11-10-00-james-golick-cooking-with-chef-your-servers-will-thank-you.html)

  Great introduction to the essence of Chef and how easy it is to write your own
  cookbooks and recipes. I agree with lots of the things James talks about here, and the
  their way of using Chef comes pretty close to how we're using it on
  [Scalarium](http://scalarium.com).

The gist of all of them for me: They're a lot less about Ruby or even Rails. Personally
I'm pretty bored of hearing yet another talk on these topics, or stuff like Cucumber.
Talks that expand my horizon beyond what people do with Rails have become a lot more
interesting to me.

Steven Frank gives you a [whole bunch of reasons](http://stevenf.com/archive/dont-use-ftp.php) not to use FTP anymore. For me, SFTP (the SSH version), together with scp, have replaced FTP long ago. FTP reminds me of the good old PHP days, when your deployment would consist of just copying your files over FTP, without backup of course, and then frantically trying to revert the change that cause your production application to break.

Well said. Me, I still use [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/). Still one of the best pieces of Mac software out there.

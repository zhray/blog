During the last meeting of the [Ruby User Group Berlin](http://www.rug-b.com), [Jonathan Weiss](http://blog.innerewut.de/) presented [Webistrano](http://blog.innerewut.de/webistrano), a web application for easy deployment based on [Capistrano](http://www.capify.org/). It was pretty impressive, and now [he's released](http://blog.innerewut.de/2007/8/28/ann-webistrano-a-web-ui-for-managing-capistrano-deployments) it to the public. On the site you'll find some screencasts explaining the features and the user interface, and the download of course.

What I find neat about it, are the multi-stage capabilities and the multi-user support. It's easy to manage several projects and hosts. As you'd expect, it's a Ruby on Rails application and comes pre-packed with all the required goodies.

Nice work Jonathan!

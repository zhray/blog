There are some interesting books on Ruby and Rails related entering the fierce market, let's have a quick look.

The first worth mentioning is ["Enterprise Recipes with Ruby and Rails"](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/msenr/enterprise-recipes-with-ruby-and-rails) by Maik Schmidt, author of ["Enterprise Integration with Ruby"](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_eir/enterprise-integration-with-ruby) (also highly recommended). Why should you read it? The book introduction answers that question short and painfully:

> "Every web site project is really an enterprise integration project in disguise."

Though it's still in Beta it seems pretty complete already.

The next one is ["Refactoring: Ruby Edition"](http://safari.oreilly.com/9780321603968). It's not secret that Martin Fowler is a [Ruby fan](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/EvaluatingRuby.html), so he teamed up with [Jay Fields](http://blog.jayfields.com/) to bring the refactoring classic up to par, and port it to Ruby.

After ["Design Patterns in Ruby"](http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321490452) this is the next classic to be coming to Ruby. If you loved the original ["Refactoring"](http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0201485672) book, this is a must. It's available as a Rough Cut, and is likely to come out in February.

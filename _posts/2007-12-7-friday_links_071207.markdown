Today's NetNewsWire tab sweep:

* [DataMapper - Competition for ActiveRecord](http://jystewart.net/process/2007/12/datamapper-competition-for-activerecord/) - Not available at the moment, [cached on the Googles](http://209.85.135.104/search?q=cache:6UjiMI3kB2EJ:jystewart.net/process/2007/12/datamapper-competition-for-activerecord/+datamapper+competition+for+activerecord&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1).  
  Looks like a nice alternative to ActiveRecord, especially for standalone environments without Rails. Being able to put queries, especially simpler ones, in Ruby code is quite appealing.

* [The Great Ruby Shoot-Out](http://antoniocangiano.com/2007/12/03/the-great-ruby-shootout/)  
  Antonio Cangiano compared the current Ruby implementations. JRuby, Ruby 1.9 and Rubinius look awesome, at least by the numbers.

* [Upcoming Changes to the JavaScript Language](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yDS1eGfuWQ)  
  I'm still not sure if I'm gonna like what's coming. JavaScript is on the way to turning into a full-blown and statically typed object-oriented language, but with all its pros and cons. It looks a lot like C++, and if that's no a little bit scary, I don't know what is.

* [Google Chart API](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/)  
  Now that's a really useful API. Put in your data via HTTP request and get back chart images. Awesome.

* [SVNMate](http://ciaranwal.sh/2007/11/29/svnmate-update)  
  A TextMate plugin to integrate Subversion, taking the integration further than the Subversion bundle.

* [Rak](http://rak.rubyforge.org/)  
  grep in Ruby, ignores .svn and CVS directories. Accepts regular expression in Ruby syntax, and can execute Ruby code on the results.

* [The Evolution of Java](http://icedjava.blogspot.com/2007/12/evolution-of-java.html)  
  Right on.

On a side node, [Rails 2.0 has been released](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/12/7/rails-2-0-it-s-done). I recommend checking out the [PeepCode](http://peepcode.com/) [book on Rails 2.0](http://peepcode.com/products/rails2-pdf) to check what's new and what's old.

Update: [Ryan Daigle](http://ryandaigle.com/) (author of aforementioned book) also has [a nice collection](http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2007/12/7/rails-2-0-final-released-summary-of-features) on a lot of the changes and new features in Rails 2.0.

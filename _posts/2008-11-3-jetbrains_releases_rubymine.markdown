IntelliJ used to be my favorite Java IDE, it was seriously _the_ tool that made the pain of working with the Java enterprise stuff bearable.

On November 1st they [released](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/ruby/2008/11/rubymine-new-ruby-and-rails-ide-from-jetbrains/) a public preview of their Ruby IDE [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/index.html).

It does feel a little shaky still, I couldn't get debugging to work, but it's a good start. I'd love having something like IntelliJ at hand, not necessarily for every day work, but especially for stuff like a good debugging session.

Keep it coming, JetBrains.

If you want to try it out, make sure you have a lot of screen real-estate at hand.

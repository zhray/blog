If that's not exciting, then I don't know what is. Original Ruby finally has got competition. I tip my hat to the team that developed JRuby in such a short time frame and now fully conforms with Ruby 1.8.x. Though I'm not keen to run JRuby in Glassfish, it's nice to have the option to integrate a Rails application with J2EE services. Think of that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_application_integration">EAI</a> buzzword that came up a few years ago. 

Being able to integrate EJB, JMS, or just every kind of Java backend with a (I'm tempted to put some buzzwords in here, think lightweight, agile, full-stack, etc., but I grew pretty tired of these) web framework like Rails is always a nice option to have. Now there's no excuse when Rails is put on the table in a Java/J2EE shop.

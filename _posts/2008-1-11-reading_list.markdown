I bought a nice stack of books recently, and I'm planning on buying some more. There's a lot of good stuff, not only new books, but also some older books (as in from 2004, I'm not talking about the C++ books on my shelf).

Currently reading:

* [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](http://www.informit.com/title/0131177052) by Michael C. Feathers. An outstanding book, review soon to come.

On the stack (in no particular order):

* [Domain-Driven Design](http://domaindrivendesign.org/books/index.html#DDD)
* [Practical JRuby on Rails Projects](http://www.apress.com/book/view/1590598814)
* [Microformats](http://microformatique.com/book/)
* [Programming Erlang](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang). Not my new favorite thing, but I want to know what all the fuzz is about.
* [Enterprise Integration Patterns](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/). 700 pages on messaging and integration, oh my.
* [Manage It!](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jrpm)

Yet to arrive or to be bought:

* [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321127420). Though from 2002 and on some topics maybe slightly outdates it's still a shame I haven't read it yet.
* [Deploying Rails Applications](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_deploy). I'm browsing through the beta already. Book due in March.
* [The Rails Way](http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321445619)
* [Design Patterns in Ruby](http://www.informit.com/title/0321490452)
* [Advanced Rails Recipes](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_arr). Beta PDF already in the browsing process.
* [The New PickAxe](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby3). Also beta PDF.

Books I'm considering to buy:

* [xUnit Test Patterns](http://xunitpatterns.com/). More than 800 on refactoring tests. The website already offers a lot of material, but also states that it might've been outdated by the book already.

There's also the occasional novel to be squeezed in. Oh well, lots of stuff to read I reckon. Thank goodness that the weekend is near. Time to read.

topics: ruby

Over at [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com), there's a [nice talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/metaprogramming-ruby) of [Dave Thomas](http://pragdave.pragprog.com/) at last year's QCon. He talks about meta programming, and how it's used in Rails to achieve all the magic that makes it what it is. Not to the tiniest details, but he explains Ruby's mechanisms which Rails uses to achieve the magic.

A nice talk, and an hour well spent. Once again Dave proves that he's an excellent speaker.

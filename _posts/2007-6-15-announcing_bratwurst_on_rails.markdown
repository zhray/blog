Registration for <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/">RailsConf Europe</a> in Berlin <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/pub/w/61/register.html">opened its doors</a> yesterday. So if you want to have one more reason to come to Berlin, head over there already.

The <a href="http://www.rug-b.com/">Ruby User Group Berlin</a> is having a party the evening before the conference, on September 16th. So if you're in town for the conference, why not drop by, say hello, meet fellow Rails friends and get free food. The event's name (and theme) is <a href="http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com/">Bratwurst On Rails</a>, and the registration is open as well. The location is yet to be announced, but that shouldn't prevent you from signing up, right?

The layout of that application has been done by lovely Joerdis Anderson, whose work you can witness over at her site <a href="http://www.beagoodgirl.net/">Be A Good Girl</a>.

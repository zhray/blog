[Great community resource](http://book.git-scm.com/) for Git started by [Scott Chacon](http://jointheconversation.org). Looks pretty good so far. Even downloadable as PDF.

By the way, GitHub just rolled out some [sweet graph awesomeness](http://github.com/blog/159-one-more-thing) features.

Also of interest might be [this small Git cheatsheet](https://37s.backpackit.com/pub/1465067) by 37signals.

Have a RESTful weekend with some REST-related reading, some of it already a little older, but it's gotten more important to me recently:
* [Refactoring DayTrader to REST](http://bitworking.org/news/201/RESTify-DayTrader). An article on refactoring an existing application to use REST.

* [Scott Raymond talks about his experiences](http://scottraymond.net/articles/2006/07/20/refactoring-to-rest) on refactoring [IconBuffet](http://www.iconbuffet.com) to REST. Unfortunately his blog isn't working right now. You can find the intro on the [homepage](http://scottraymond.net) and unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a cached copy anywhere.

* [The RESTful Rails PeepCode](http://peepcode.com/products/restful-rails). Geoff also made a [cheat sheet](http://topfunky.com/clients/peepcode/REST-cheatsheet.pdf) which always comes in handy.

* [RailsCast on custom REST actions](http://railscasts.com/episodes/35). All hail to `:new`, `:member` and `:collection`.

* [RailsCast on REST authorization](http://railscasts.com/episodes/67).

* Not related to REST, but still interesting for the Mac geek using QuickSilver, Nikolas Jitkoff gives a [tech talk](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8493378861634507068&q=user%3A%22Google+engEDU%22&total=333&start=0&num=10&so=1&type=search&plindex=0) at Google, captured on Google Video for your viewing pleasure.

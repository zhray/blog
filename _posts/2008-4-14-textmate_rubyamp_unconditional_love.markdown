This is the bundle that'll make TextMate almost as good as warm apple pie. [RubyAMP](http://code.leadmediapartners.com/tools/rubyamp/) comes along with a few additions to Ruby coding in TextMate, but boy do they rock.

Some of its features:

* Grep for Method
* Grep for Class/Module, both method and class/module grep use the word under the cursor
* A much faster (compared to "Find in Project") "Grep in Project"
* Code completion with data from all open files
* An intelligent "Go to file" which will try to find something matching the word under the cursor
* Run RSpec in the debugger

Here's code completion in action:

On the website you'll find a video showing most of the features. Pretty neato. Ruby and Rails development on the Mac just got even sweeter.

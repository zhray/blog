<a href="http://macrabbit.com/">MacRabbit</a> today <a href="http://macrabbit.com/blog/cssedit-25-out-now/">released</a> <a href="http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/">CSSEdit</a> v2.5, a release sporting some nice new features, amongst them tabs (gotta have those), a shiny inspector for X-ray to get all the details on the styles a particular element has, and last but not least, a selector builder to make the sometimes-hassle of building the right selector a visual pleasure.

CSSEdit is one of my favorite tools on the Mac. It's a perfect example how design and function can be integrated into a focussed and usable application.

Go grab it while it's hot.

In other news, the good folks at <a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a> today released <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>, an integrated web development environment. Mind you, it's not Dreamweaver, no, it looks better. Though I prefer my stack of tools it definitely looks like a thought-through and well-designed tool. I'll definitely take it for a spin.

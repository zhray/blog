Well, not quite. It's been quite around here lately. I've been swamped with work over the last two months which is, of course, not a bad thing. The good thing is that I've seen several projects going live over the last few weeks.

I had the pleasure to improve the [job board](http://jobs.freelanceswitch.com) for [FreelanceSwitch.com](http://www.freelanceswitch.com) to support a subscription based model. Since Paypal supports recurring payments it was the way to go. I can now safely say that developing Paypal applicaations is a PITA. Instant Payment Notifications are a weird concept, and it took me a while to get my head around it. For testing you just can't get around using mocking to effectively test IPN handling. More on that in a later post.

The other project is [palabea](http://www.palabea.net), and e-learning community, which recently went into public beta. Well worth checking out.

And, just for fun, I'd like to point to the website of our local [cupcake dealer](http://www.cupcakeberlin.de). I do love them so.

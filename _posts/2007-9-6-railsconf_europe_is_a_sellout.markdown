Yep. [It's sold out](http://www.railsconfeurope.com). Compared to the RailsConf in Portland it took a while, but now you can expect to meet something around 800 people there. I'm really looking forward to it, as well as [Bratwurst on Rails](http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com) which will be doing pretty good as well regarding participants.

* [ThoughtWorks Podcasts](http://www.thoughtworks.com/what-we-say/podcasts.html). There are two podcasts available, where Martin Fowler and Jay Fields talk about DSLs.

* [Atomic Commit in SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html). An interesting read, if you're into database internals.

* [Live Mongrel Debugging and Recovery](http://www.igvita.com/2008/02/19/live-mongrel-debugging-and-recovery/). A nice article that also leads to the following entries.

* [Mongrel Timeout / Throttle Misnomer](http://www.igvita.com/2007/09/24/mongrel-timeout-throttle-misnomer/). Yep, Mongrel's -t parameter is confusing.

* [A Couple of Quick Mongrel Tips](http://the-mooses-house.blogspot.com/2008/02/couple-of-quick-mongrel-tips.html). Some nice Mongrel tips.

* [Process title support for Mongrel](http://purefiction.net/mongrel_proctitle/). Now that's just cool. Nice and simple way to monitor at least some basic Mongrel process states.

* [TextMate Tip - The Ruby Bundle](http://ciaranwal.sh/2008/02/20/textmate-tip-the-ruby-bundle). Ciar&aacute;n Walsh regularly posts a bunch of TextMate tips. Well worth reading.

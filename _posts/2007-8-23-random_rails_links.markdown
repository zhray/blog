* Chad Fowler and Marcel Molina are holding a [full-day Rails testing tutorial](http://www.chadfowler.com/2007/8/21/railsconf-europe-full-day-testing-tutorial) on the day before the sessions of RailsConf Europe. That would be September 17th. You're expected to fork over $75 for the entry, but fear not, the money is for a good cause and the donation is tax-deductible.
* A while ago [Ola Bini called](http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2007/04/activehibernate-any-takers.html) for an implementation of [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org) for [JRuby](http://jruby.codehaus.org/). [Johan Andries](http://rubymatic.blogspot.com/) is giving it a try: [ActiveHibernate](http://code.google.com/p/activehibernate/) on Google Code (via [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/08/jruby-active-hibernate))
* A year after the initial listing on their website, The Pragmatic Programmers announced ["Deploying Rails Applications"](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_deploy/index.html). Written by Ezra Zygmuntowicz (of BackgrounDRb fame) and Bruce Tate it aims to offer all kinds of wisdom about running Rails applications in the wild. It's still in beta, but I know I'm gonna grab a copy.
* Adding time zones to a Rails application is something I was doing this week. Of great help were the [introduction by Jamis Buck](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/2/2/introducing-tztime) and [an article by Courtenay of caboose fame](http://blog.caboo.se/articles/2007/2/23/adding-timezone-to-your-rails-app)

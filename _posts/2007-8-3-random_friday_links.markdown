 * [WestCIV](http://www.westciv.com/), makers of the fabulous [Style Master CSS Editor](http://www.westciv.com/style_master/index.html), introduced a neat tool called [XRAY](http://www.westciv.com/xray/index.html) to inspect any website in your browser without any extra tools. While I'm perfectly aware that FireBug can do that too, let me just state that I don't use Firefox as my main browser. XRAY might come in pretty handy, if you don't have the tools you normally use, at hand.
 * [Amy Newell](http://www.thirdbit.net/) sums up [10 things you should know about method_missing](http://www.thirdbit.net/articles/2007/08/01/10-things-you-should-know-about-method_missing/) rather nicely.
 * [Edge Rails adds support for partial layouts](http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2007/8/3/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-partials-get-layouts). DRY up that partial code, I say.
 * [Happy Third Anniversary, Rails](http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/10-three-years-with-ruby-on-rails). I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that you brought so much joy and passion back into our complexity- and heavyweight-infested lives.
 * [Atlassian acquires Cenqua](http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/08/atlassiancenqua). It's about time that two Sydney-based companies building [most](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/) [excellent](http://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/) [tools](http://www.atlassian.com/software/clover/) finally go hand in hand.
